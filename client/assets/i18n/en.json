    "markdown" : "This web app has been created so you can optimize your chaining with differents units on the game Final Fantasy Brave Exvius\n\r\n\rThis app focusses on the global version of FFBE, however, some units or awakened abilities are already available for future comparison (e.g. Aileen enhanced Piledriver, or 6* Zidane)\n\rFor now, you will find the following features :\n\r - Calculate chain with chainers and finishers\n\r - Find best unit and combo based on your selection\n\r - Generate macro for memu and nox\n\r - Create and save your own units. (This option saves your units in your browser, if you change browser or use another computer, you will not be able to find them)\n\r\n\r---\n\r\n\r##### Change Logs :\n\r\n\r20/10/2017\n\r - Add translation system for French language (maybe more later)\n\r - Add espers in the calculator\n\r\n\r19/10/2017\n\r - Add Grim Lord Sakura, Pirate Jake and Illusionist Nichol\n\r - Add Setzer's Double Dice (I put a fake modifier to not break the system, but the timing is good ^^)\n\r - Add enhanced abilities for Trance Terra and Emperor\n\r\n\r12/10/2017\n\r - Update Pod 153 (9S' TMR) as a unit to be easily findable in the list\n\r - Add Toxic Rain (Octopus reward) and Alterna (Noctis' TMR)\n\r - Update Nyx and Glauca with their officials global skills name\n\r\n\r11/10/2017\n\r - Macro are finally here :)\n\r - Memu and Nox are working\n\r - However the result in-game can differ from the chart... In-game lag, some data that are not in the datamine files (offset and cast time)\n\r - Don't forget to not put any acceleration in your macro\n\r\n\r06/10/2017\n\r - Add Goken as a chainer\n\r\n\r02/10/2017\n\r - After three weeks of rest playing Monster Hunter Stories, sorry :( , I'm back into business :)\n\r - So to your pleasure, and also mine, you can now add finisher in the app. The calculator work pretty well with them so feel free to test\n\r - I also decide to add the possibility for chainers to have finisher ability, like Tidus and his Jetch Shot\n\r - Add lot of finisher (Luneth, Fire Veritas, A2, ...)\n\r - If you think I miss good finisher feel free to contact me\n\r\n\r---\n\r\n\rThat's all for now, but I will keep improving this app, my next steps being (not in a specific order) :\n\r - Share units and chain setups with your friends\n\r - Calculate damages based on units/monsters characteristics\n\r\n\rIf you're lost, new to the game and don't know what chaining is in FFBE, nor how it works, I suggest that you go check out the [FFBE sub-reddit], or the [english wiki] for further information\n\r\n\rBig thanks to the following people for all their hard work that help me to build this app :\n\r - [Xeleko]\n\r - [/u/Fatalderp]\n\r - [/u/Nazta]\n\r - [/u/Cyanjet]\n\r - [/u/Solaris]\n\r - All the sub-reddit community\n\r\n\r**Bismark**\n\r[FFBE sub-reddit]: https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius\n\r[english wiki]: https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Final_Fantasy_Brave_Exvius_Wiki\n\r[Xeleko]: https://www.youtube.com/user/Xeleko\n\r[/u/Fatalderp]: https://www.reddit.com/user/Fatalderp\n\r[/u/Nazta]: https://www.reddit.com/user/Nazta\n\r[/u/Cyanjet]: https://www.reddit.com/user/Cyanjet\n\r[/u/Solaris]: https://www.reddit.com/user/__solaris__\n\r"
