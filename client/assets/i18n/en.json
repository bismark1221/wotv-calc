    "markdown" : "This web app has been created so you can optimize your chaining with differents units on the game Final Fantasy Brave Exvius\n\r\n\rThis app focusses on the global version of FFBE, however, some units or awakened abilities are already available for future comparison (e.g. 6* Zidane)\n\rFor now, you will find the following features :\n\r - Calculate chain with chainers and finishers\n\r - Find best unit and combo based on your selection\n\r - Generate macro for memu and nox\n\r - Create and save your own units. (This option saves your units in your browser, if you change browser or use another computer, you will not be able to find them)\n\r\n\r---\n\r\n\r##### Change Logs :\n\r\n\r09/08\n\r - Nalu patch\n\r\n\r02/08\n\r - FF8 patch\n\r - The 7 stars are finally here, have fun with there new skills :)\n\r\n\r26/07\n\r - Star Ocean Patch + Awakening abilities + 3 stars Titan\n\r\n\r19/07\n\r - Awakened Rain and Mediena Patch\n\r\n\r13/07\n\r - Reagen Patch\n\r\n\r08/06\n\r - You can now update the multicast abilities by yourself\n\r\n\r24/05\n\r - Add a new page to show chain families\n\r - It's a 'raw' page, generated from raw data without any check\n\r - So you will find future units or awaikenings\n\r\n\r11/05\n\r - Well, it's been a long time since the last major upgrade... But I'm back with a new system for the simulator, the dual-abilities\n\r - You can know choose differents abilities during a dualcast or dualabilities\n\r - You choose the 1st ability and the 2nd one, same as in-game\n\r - I also add the posibilities to view units' and abilities' translation for all supported language in the data\n\r - If you find some bug don't hesitate to contact me :)\n\r\n\r23/01\n\r - Hello everyone, As some of you noticed the site has not been updated for 2 weeks :( Really sorry, I changed house, I had to do some work and no internet during 10 days disturbed me a lot ... But I'm back and the site is up to date :)\n\r - Added the last 2 banners (Balthier, Pyro Glacial Lasswell, ...)\n\r - Added the latest awakening (Aileen, Vicoria, ...)\n\r\n\r04/01\n\r - Happy New Year :)\n\r - Right now I don't time to adapt the simulator to the triple cast of Kaliva... It should be good in 2 weeks, sorry...\n\r\n\r19/12\n\r - Damage dristribution for an ability are now implemented (For exemple Cloud's LB is 5% per hit expect for the last one which is 30%)\n\r\n\r04/12\n\r - Only show chainers on the search for best units (because the order for finishers is almost always the same...)\n\r\n\r11/11\n\r - Translation for Taiwan (traditional chinese) thanks to [/u/GiveMeZidane]\n\r\n\r01/11\n\r - New page to explain how chain really work in game\n\r - Change how to show options on the simulator (click on the gear)\n\r\n\r20/10\n\r - Add translation system for French language (maybe more later)\n\r - Add espers in the calculator\n\r\n\r---\n\r\n\rThat's all for now, but I will keep improving this app, my next steps being (not in a specific order) :\n\r - Share units and chain setups with your friends\n\r - Calculate damages based on units/monsters characteristics\n\r\n\rIf you're lost, new to the game and don't know what chaining is in FFBE, nor how it works, I suggest that you go check out the [FFBE sub-reddit], or the [english wiki] for further information\n\r\n\rBig thanks to the following people for all their hard work that help me to build this app :\n\r - [Xeleko]\n\r - [/u/Fatalderp]\n\r - [/u/Nazta]\n\r - [/u/Cyanjet]\n\r - [/u/Solaris]\n\r - All the sub-reddit community\n\r\n\r**Bismark**\n\r[FFBE sub-reddit]: https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius\n\r[english wiki]: https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Final_Fantasy_Brave_Exvius_Wiki\n\r[Xeleko]: https://www.youtube.com/user/Xeleko\n\r[/u/Fatalderp]: https://www.reddit.com/user/Fatalderp\n\r[/u/Nazta]: https://www.reddit.com/user/Nazta\n\r[/u/Cyanjet]: https://www.reddit.com/user/Cyanjet\n\r[/u/Solaris]: https://www.reddit.com/user/__solaris__\n\r[/u/GiveMeZidane]: https://dm.reddit.com/user/GiveMeZidane\n\r"

    "markdown" : "### Chains\n\r\n\r#### How does the game work ?\n\rThe first thing you should know when starting to play with chain, is that the game run on 60 frames per second\n\r\n\rThis is important because hits of abilities hit each X frames and not in seconds or milliseconds\n\r\n\rBut we can easily find that 1 frame = 16.66 milliseconds\n\r\n\r#### What is a chain ?\n\rIt's when 2 units, or more, hit the target whit alternating hits\n\r\n\rHere a small exemple: The first unit will hit first, then the second unit hit, next the first unit hit again, then the second one, etc...\n\r\n\rWhen you see in game \"Combo\", it's that you are already in a chain :)\n\r\n\r#### Why chaining is important ?\n\rBecause it's nice to see high combo ^^\n\r\n\rNo I'm kidding, it's important because at each combo the power of the hits increase by a certain rate up to 400%\n\r\n\rHere is the detail of the modifications\n\r - Neutral combo : 10%\n\r - Elemental combo : 20% by elements\n\r - Spark combo : 30%\n\r\n\rKnowing that each of thoses combo can be combined, if you do a spark fire/water combo so the power gain 80% in one hit\n\r\n\rYou can find bellow a table which show the number of hit necessary to reach the maximum power\n\r\n\r![chain modifier][chain_modifier]\n\r\n\r#### Break a chain\n\rThere is 2 way to break a chain\n\r - An unit hit twice in a row\n\r - If there is more than 21 frames between 2 hits\n\r\n\rWhen a chain is break, we start again at 0 combo and the power drop to 100%\n\r\n\r#### Add a finisher in a chain\n\rAt any moment you can add another unit in a chain to take advantage of the rise of power\n\r\n\rIt become interested to use some finisher, units who have abilities which do only one hit\n\r\n\rWith those spells, all their power is rise with one hit, moreover those abilities are more powerfull than the chain skills generally\n\r\n\rSo we need to try to include them as soon as the power is at 400%\n\r\n\r#### Analyse data find on internet\n\rThere is multiple way to write data about abilities\n\r\n\rLet's take an example with Tidus' Quick Hit\n\r - Frames version : 22-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-20\n\r - Cumulative version : 22-27-32-37-42-47-52-57-62-67-72-92\n\r - ffbe-chain version : 0-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-20\n\r\n\rThe first number in the 2 first example is the first hit of the ability, here 22\n\r\n\rThat mean that Tidus will hit with his Quick Hit at 22 frames after you tap on the unit, so that's 22 x 16.66 = 366.52 milliseconds\n\r\n\rNext thanks to the first example, we know that the second hit came 5 frames after the first one, so that's 27 frames (We can find this data on the cumulative version)\n\r\n\r#### What's happen with a dualwield/dualcast\n\rLet's review again our Tidus with his Quick Hit (22-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-20)\n\r\n\rLet's imagine that Tidus has 2 weapons, so a dualcast, in this case we need another data : At when moment start the 2nd spell ?\n\r\n\rWe can find the extracted data the cast time of any ability, for Quick Hit it's 20 frames\n\r\n\rIn theory we should have the following result\n\r - 1st spell: 22-27-32-37-42-47-52-57-62-67-72-92\n\r - 2nd spell: 42-47-52-57-62-67-72-77-82-87-92-112\n\r\n\r![fake tidus quick hit][fake_quick_hit]\n\r\n\rUnfortunately is not so simple... Thank to Whaat on reddit, we have discover that some abilities have an extra delay, named offset, but this data is not on the data files... ([Multi-Hit Chain Reference/Hit Data] and [frame delays on dualhit])\n\r\n\rFor the Quick Hit, we have find that the offset is 16 frames, so here are the real data for Tidus\n\r - 1st spell: 22-27-32-37-42-47-52-57-62-67-72-92\n\r - 2nd spell: 58-63-68-73-78-83-88-93-98-103-108-128\n\r\n\r![real tidus quick hit][real_quick_hit]\n\r\n\rLike you can see, the 2nd spell start before the ending of the first one, it's the case for lot of units\n\r\n\rHere is the case of Orlandeau who \"wait\" for his first spell to finish before launching the 2nd one\n\r\n\r![orlandeau][orlandeau]\n\r\n\r#### What is a spark ?\n\rA spark combo is when 2 units hit on the same frame, be careful only 1 of the 2 hit is concidered as a spark\n\r\n\r#### The positioning is important when chaining\n\rA new discovery, for myself, it's that the positioning can play an important part in your chains\n\r\n\rAn unit who is on a smaller position than another will always hit before the other, even in a spark combo\n\r\n\rAnd it's in this case that some weird things can happen...\n\r\n\rIt's the case of Tidus and Pirate Jake, I put here a small video of my youtube channel to show this odd behavior\n\r\n\r<iframe class=\"youtube\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTmBNy9jMDY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\r\n\rBut don't worry, this is already implemented on the simulator :)\n\r\n\r![chain tidus and pirate jake][tidus_pirate_jake]\n\r\n\r##### Macros\n\rI will not explain here how to use macro on your emulators because there is already lot a pretty good tutorials\n\r\n\rI just put some little rules which can be useful\n\r - Memu : Be careful, you need to have an extra empty line at the end of your macro files (This empty line is generated in the simulator, so if you click on the Copy button there shouldn't have any problems)\n\r\n\r[chain_modifier]: ../../assets/how-to/ffbe_chain_modifier.png \"Chain Modifier\"\n\r[fake_quick_hit]: ../../assets/how-to/fake_quick_hit.png \"Fake Quick Hit\"\n\r[real_quick_hit]: ../../assets/how-to/real_quick_hit.png \"Real Quick Hit\"\n\r[orlandeau]: ../../assets/how-to/orlandeau.png \"Chain Orlandeau\"\n\r[tidus_pirate_jake]: ../../assets/how-to/tidus_pirate_jake.png \"Chain Tidus and Pirate Jake\"\n\r[Multi-Hit Chain Reference/Hit Data]: https://dm.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/5dbam6/jp_multihit_chain_referencehit_data\n\r[frame delays on dualhit]: https://dm.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/6ct7uc/frame_delays_for_many_popular_chaining_moves\n\r"
