    This web app is here to help you to optimized your chain in FFBE.

    I follow the global version of FFBE, even if you can find some upgrade or units before we have them in global.
    For now you will find the following features :
     - Chain with 2 units
     - Create and save your own units (they are saved in your browser, if you go on another computer you will not find them)

    That's all for now, but I will keep to improve this app.
    My next steps, not necessarily in this order it's depends of my brain :
    - Find units based on chain
    - Include finisher
    - Share units and chain with others
    - Calculate damage based on units and monster characteristics
    - Generate macro
    - Mobile version

    There is some little bug that I know and I'm currently working on it :
    - Calculation for hybrid ability aren't manage, so there is no result for chain including hybrid ability

    If you just discover FFBE or don't know what chaining are in FFBE, you can go en [FFBE sub-reddit] or in the [english wiki]
    If you are new to Final Fantasy Brave Exvius, I recommend joining us over at the Sub-Reddit.
