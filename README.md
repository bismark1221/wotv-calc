# WOTV-CALC

Welcome to wotv-calc, an online tool for [War Of The Visions](https://wotvffbe.com/).
You can find infos on units, cards, ... and also make some build to try some stuff before loosing time or resources in game.

Check it out here: https://wotv-calc.com

# How to run locally
This first point I need to explain is this repo is only the front of the website. For the moment I want to keep for myself the back code.
But don't worry you will be able to run the front locally without problem and be plugged on the website api to be always up to date with new data.

One last warning, you will not be able to use the same account locally than from wotv-calc.com

## Install the project
Clone the project
Run `npm install`
Install angular globally `npm install -g @angular/cli` (Optional but easier to run command)
And that's it

## Run the project
Run `ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json`
And that's it you have a working wotv-calc running here `http://localhost:4200`

## Linting
I will check linting for every pull request so don't hesitate to run this command to check everything : `ng lint`
