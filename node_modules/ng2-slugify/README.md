ng2-slugify
=============

> Converts a string into a slug

Angular2 Slugify
----------------

Features
--------

- Removes all special characters from a string.
- Provides custom replacements for German, French, Spanish, Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Czech, Latvian, Greek,
Esperanto, Arabian, Vietnamese, Burmese, Danish, Turkish, Finnish, Swedish, and Georgian special characters. Instead of
removing these characters, Slugify approximates them (e.g., `ae` replaces `Ã¤`).

Installation
------------

You can install Slugify through npm:

```shell
$ npm install ng2-slugify
```

If you are using SystemJS you can map to ng2-slugify in your configuration.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<script>
  SystemJS.config({
    map: {
      "ng2-slugify": "node_modules/ng2-slugify/ng2-slugify.js"
    }
  });
</script>
```

Usage Example
-------------

```ts
import {Component} from 'angular2/core';
import {Slug} from 'ng2-slugify';

class Test {
  title: string,
  slug:  string
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app',
  template: `
    <input type="text" 
           placeholder="Title"
           [(ngModel)]="test.title"
           ngControl="title"
           (keyup)="generateSlug()"
           required>
    <input type="text" 
           placeholder="Slug"
           [(ngModel)]="test.slug"
           ngControl="slug"
           readonly="true" 
           required>
  `
})

export class App {
  public test = new Test();
  private slug = new Slug(); // this will use 'default' keymap
  private slugGerman = new Slug('german'); // for list of all available keymaps see bellow

  public generateSlug(): void {
    this.test.slug = this.slug.slugify(this.test.title);
  }
