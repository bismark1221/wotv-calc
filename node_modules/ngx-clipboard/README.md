# ngx-clipboard , F.K.A [angular2-clipboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular2-clipboard)

From 6.0.0, there is no dependency anymore. Just Angular.

It works with angular version 2.0.0 and up

To make more sense with the future versioning scheme of Angular, the directive selector is now rename to **ngxClipboard**

## Dependencies

+ Angular >=4.0.0 

If you need to use it on 2.0.0, please use version 7.x.x.

The code are pretty much the same, in 8.0.0 it uses InjectionToken which requires angular4.

## Install

You can get it on npm.

```
npm install ngx-clipboard --save
```

## Build project

```
1. npm i

2. npm run build
```
## Usage

If you use SystemJS to load your files, you might have to update your config:

```js
System.config({
    map: {
        'ngx-clipboard': 'node_modules/ngx-clipboard'
    }
});
```

For webpack / Angular CLI, it works as any other libraries. Please check demo folder for more help. 

This library support 2 kinds of copy source. 

You can either set 
```
[cbContent]="'target string'"
```
Or 

```
[ngxClipboard]="inputTarget" 
```

Or

You can just use copyFromContent from clipboard.service to copy any text you dynamically created.

## Contributing 

1. Your commits conform to the conventions established [here](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-angular/blob/master/convention.md)
2. This project used [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) and [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to handle npm version from CI
    + run git add first to add your changes to staging 
    + use `npm run commit` to commit, and CI will do the rest.
    + if changes contain breaking change, use `BREAKING CHANGE` keyword in the comment to trigger major release
    + before push to git and trigger CI, you can dry run `npm run semantic-release` locally to make sure the version number is push as expected.

## Troubleshooting

1. If you use webpack, check `/demo/webpack`. Try to use the same version of webpack that demo used, if you run into any error.

2. The latest version (3.0.0+) works with AoT, please check [/demo/angular2-aot-webpack](https://github.com/maxisam/ngx-clipboard/tree/master/demo/angular2-aot-webpack) to see how to make it work.
