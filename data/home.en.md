This web app has been created so you can optimize your chaining with differents units on the game Final Fantasy Brave Exvius

This app focusses on the global version of FFBE, however, some units or awakened abilities are already available for future comparison (e.g. 6* Zidane)
For now, you will find the following features :
 - Calculate chain with chainers and finishers
 - Find best unit and combo based on your selection
 - Generate macro for memu and nox
 - Create and save your own units. (This option saves your units in your browser, if you change browser or use another computer, you will not be able to find them)
