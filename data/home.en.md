This web app has been created so you can optimize your chaining with differents units on the game Final Fantasy Brave Exvius

This app focusses on the global version of FFBE, however, some units or awakened abilities are already available for future comparison (e.g. Aileen enhanced Piledriver, or 6* Zidane)
For now, you will find the following features :
 - Calculate chain with chainers and finishers
 - Find best unit and combo based on your selection
 - Generate macro for memu and nox
 - Create and save your own units. (This option saves your units in your browser, if you change browser or use another computer, you will not be able to find them)

That's all for now, but I will keep improving this app, my next steps being (not in a specific order) :
 - Share units and chain setups with your friends
 - Calculate damages based on units/monsters characteristics

If you're lost, new to the game and don't know what chaining is in FFBE, nor how it works, I suggest that you go check out the [FFBE sub-reddit], or the [english wiki] for further information
